# What is waiting for the next `pools.py` re-emit window

**A CODE change to `src/pools.py` moves `pools_sha` and invalidates all eighteen
pool specs.** Re-emitting is cheap and deterministic — it changes nothing but the
key — but it is expensive in *coordination*: while it runs, **nobody may run the
model, `compare_history`, or any sweep**, because a number measured against a
moving artefact is not a measurement (CLAUDE.md, "Shared artefacts").

So `pools.py` changes are **batched**, and this file is the batch. Opened
2026-08-28 at the owner's instruction: *"batch it. keep a log of what goes in it
as we move along."*

**A comment-or-docstring-only change to `pools.py` does NOT move the hash** and
does not belong here — verified again on 2026-08-28 (`dbdf171344ffd5` before and
after declaring `_LOG_FLOOR`). Only changes to what the code *computes* qualify.

## The window, when it is taken

1. Land every queued change below in one commit.
2. Re-emit all eighteen specs, with nothing else running:

       for c in joburg tshwane ekurhuleni ethekwini capetown mangaung \
                nelsonmandelabay buffalocity; do
         for y in 2016 2021; do
           .venv/bin/python src/pools.py --city $c --target $y --emit
         done
       done
       .venv/bin/python src/pools.py --city joburg --target 2026 --emit
       .venv/bin/python src/pools.py --city joburg --target 2026 --simulation --emit

3. Confirm all eighteen carry ONE `pools_sha` and that it matches the new code.
4. Re-take the baseline (`compare_history`) and the freeze, in that order, on a
   settled tree. **Every number quoted afterwards comes from that run.**

## Queued

| # | change | why it needs the window | raised |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | **`pools._target_roll` reads the crosswalk from `target.processed`** (`pools.py:1910`) and must read `city.processed` — i.e. `target.crosswalk`. **This is what blocks `pools.py --city <any non-joburg> --target 2026 --emit`**, so no second city can have a 2026 spec until it lands. Its own docstring already states the intent ("that lands in *the city's own processed directory*"); the code disagrees with it. The refusal message at `:1912-1922` names the wrong path and must be corrected with it. | Changing a path expression changes what the code computes, so it moves `pools_sha`. Everything else in F15 landed in §1.120 without touching `pools.py`. | §1.120, 2026-08-28 |
| 1 | **`pools.CONFIG` is frozen as a function default** in three signatures — `artefact_key`, `stale_reason`, `load_config` (`config_path: Path = CONFIG`). Rebinding `pools.CONFIG` moves nothing, in parent or worker. | Resolving it in the body is a change to what the code computes. It is the `LEVEL_DF` §1.33 class, and it is why `pools.CONFIG` is deliberately **left out** of `montecarlo.MODULE_CONSTANTS` — declaring it would record the live attribute while the computation used the frozen one, which is a FALSE delivery proof rather than a missing one (§1.106). | §1.106, 2026-08-27 |

## Considered and NOT queued

* **`pools._LOG_FLOOR`** — kept and declared rather than deleted (owner,
  2026-08-28). Unexercised, not dead: the two-census interpolation is capability
  a second census would need immediately, and the Stats SA correspondence is
  live on exactly that. Declared by comment and in `JUDGEMENT-CALLS.md`, neither
  of which moves the hash. §1.119
* **The `ALPHA_*` family and the other ten emit-time constants** — no change is
  proposed. They are correctly absent from `MODULE_CONSTANTS`; their delivery
  proof is `pools_sha` itself, so a sweep of any of them that does not move the
  key never arrived (§1.106).
* **F18's crosswalk deduplication** — deliberately scoped to leave `pools.py`
  alone. `pools._target_roll` is a separate, intentional roll sum and stays
  (§1.116).
